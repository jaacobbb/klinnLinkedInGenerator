            "output": "Failure isn't the opposite of success, it's a stepping stone. üöÄ In my early startup days, I clung to an idea for far too long, convinced it would eventually work. The market, however, had other plans. It was a tough pill to swallow, but I learned one of the most invaluable lessons: the power of failing fast and pivoting even faster. Instead of wasting months, we shifted our strategy in weeks, embracing user feedback and market signals. This quick adaptation saved us from a deeper hole and ultimately led us to a much stronger product-market fit. Don't be afraid to let go of what isn't working. Your next big win might just be a pivot away. What's the biggest lesson failure has taught you? Share your insights below! #StartupLessons #Entrepreneurship #Pivot #LearningFromFailure #Innovation"
